    "In this assignment, you will focus on computing the confidence interval for the mean of a dataset using statistical methods. Confidence intervals are a key concept in inferential statistics, allowing us to estimate a range of plausible values for a population parameter (in this case, the mean) based on sample data. The goal is to understand and apply the formula for constructing a confidence interval and interpret the results in a practical context.\n",
